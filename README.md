## About this project

This project was conceived as an experiment to explore the capabilities of Next.js 13. The primary objective was to build a modern application that incorporates a variety of features including, but not limited to, authentication, API route handlers, middleware, and server components.

The application is designed to simulate a video call platform, providing a practical context in which to apply and test these features. It leverages the power of Next.js 13 to handle server-side operations, routing, and server side rendering.

Key features of the application include:

- User Authentication: Ensuring secure access to the application and protecting user data.
- API Routes: Facilitating communication between the client and server, enabling data exchange for various application features.
- iddleware: Managing the sequence of functions that process requests and responses.
- Server Components: Utilizing Next.js 13's server components to deliver an optimized user experience.
T
his project is an ongoing experiment, with plans for further exploration and expansion of its capabilities.

## Known Issues

A list of things not working right now:

1. Share screen functionality is not working.
2. Invite email is not working. (Using React Email and Nodmailer, email sending works, but Resend with React Email throws this error when sending: "The gmail.com domain is not verified. Please, add and verify your domain on Resend". The doamin has been verified and an api key generated for it. I can't seem to find any documentation or issues online that address this.)
